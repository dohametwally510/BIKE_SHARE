# Udacity Bikeshare Project
This is the second project for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program where bike rideshare data for a few select cities (New York, Chicago, and Washington, DC) are used to create a terminal application that gives a set of summary statistics for each city. This is implemented in Python.
