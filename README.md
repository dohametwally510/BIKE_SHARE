# BIKE_SHARE
This is the second project for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program where bike rideshare data for a few select cities (New York, Chicago, and Washington, DC) are used to create a terminal application that gives a set of summary statistics for each city. This is implemented in Python.
This Python script is written for Project 2 (Term 1) of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) and is used to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It imports data from csv files and compute descriptive statistics from the data. It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

# Project Title
My-Udacity-Bikeshare-Project
# Date created
The project was launched on 10/20/2020
# Description
My Udacity project that I have made to improve my skills in pandas for a nano-degree Udacity program. . 
Now it's time to collect and explore our data. In this project, I will focus on the record of individual trips taken in 2016 from our selected cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Each of these cities has a page where we can freely download the trip data.
